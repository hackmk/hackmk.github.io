            <h3>tl;dr:</h3>
            <p>Both software, and hardware, in English. No programming language restrictions. Free attendance and food, and you can stay overnight.</p>

              <p>HacK.M.K is a 24 hour student hackathon. We warmly welcome every kind of students, to create awesome projects.</p>
              <p>Over the weekend, hackathon participants form teams of up to 4 people, and have 24 hours to build a project before presenting it in front of a jury, who decide who will win the prizes. Hackathons are a great opportunity for students to take their knowledge out of the classroom, experiment with new and exciting technology, and make lasting friendships with like minded people.</p>
            </div>
            <a class="faqkep02"></a>
            <p class="faq faq02">A hackathon is best described as an ‘invention marathon’. Amongst the computing community, to hack is to build a project in a short time simply to demonstrate an idea or play around with new technologies.</p>
            <a class="faqkep03"></a>
            <p class="faq faq03">Don't worry if you don't have a team already! We'll find one for you. Before the hacking there will be a short event, where those without premade partners could find other people to team up with.</p>
            <a class="faqkep04"></a>
            <p class="faq faq04">HacK.M.K is a student hackathon, and therefore you must currently be a student, with a valid Student ID.</p>
            <a class="faqkep05"></a>
            <p class="faq faq05">You don’t have to be a coder to participate in the hackathon! You can still become a valuable team member, offering a fresh perspective, or perhaps by bringing other skills to the table such as design, data analysis or insight into user need. Hackathons are  great opportunities to learn too, it's a friendly environment where the mentors will help the teams by sharing their knowledge. So come along if you'd like to develop your coding skills!</p>
            <a class="faqkep06"></a>
            <p class="faq faq06">Your choice, we only give you the thematic of the project, you can choose your mean of realisation. From our perspective, your imagination is the only restriction.</p>
            <a class="faqkep07"></a>
            <p class="faq faq07">Of course you can! We provide a resting place, although you should consider bringing some sleeping stuff, such as a pillow or sleeping bag, to make you as cosy as possible.</p>
            <a class="faqkep08"></a>
            <p class="faq faq08">Nothing! HacK.M.K is free to attend, with the venue and all food provided by our fantastic partners and sponsors.</p>
            <a class="faqkep09"></a>
            <p class="faq faq09">All food across the weekend will be provided free of charge - from lunch on Saturday through to breakfast on Sunday. All dietary requirements will be considered and catered for. In order to gather this data we’ll make sure to reach out to every one of you, before the event takes place.</p>
            <a class="faqkep10"></a>
            <p class="faq faq10">All intellectual property generated at our hackathon belongs to the developer. However, to generate the widest benefit from this event, we encourage hackers to provide Open Source licenses for the results of their creativity.</p>
            <a class="faqkep11"></a>
            <p class="faq faq11">While you can explore ideas and produce designs before HacK.M.K, you cannot write a line of code for your project before the event itself. We’d like this event to happen in the spirit of fair play, so please be honest, we aren’t lying about the food either. :)</p>
            <a class="faqkep12"></a>
            <p class="faq faq12">Bring your laptop, charger(s) and any other devices you wish to work on at the hackathon. Although we are trying to provide electronic components, such as sensors and resistors, etc, we highly recommend to have your own board, and some components to boot your idea with. If you are staying overnight, you will also need to bring toiletries, and a sleeping bag or blanket and pillow.</p>
